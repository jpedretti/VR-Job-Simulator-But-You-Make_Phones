# VR Job Simulator, But You Make Phones

This is a VR project that clones the popular VR game Job Simulator, but with a twist: instead of working in an office, a store, or a kitchen, you work in a phone factory.

You can also interact with various objects and tools in the factory, such as hammers, screwdrivers, wires, batteries, etc.
